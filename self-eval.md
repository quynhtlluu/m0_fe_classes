# Self Evaluation

- **This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?**

It felt incredibly difficult. I was not able to solve most of the challenges for this lesson successfully. I feel more motivated to teach myself more material.

- **How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?**

My workflow is going okay. I try to take breaks during periods of unproductive struggle. However, I know that my daily workflow would ultimately benefit from more rest and time.

- **What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?**

I would prefer to be given leeway on tasks on days where I might not be able to successfully finish them due to factors related to stress. I also would like to be able to reach out to mentors and peers more as we go through more challenges.
